# Pattern-Recognition-Version-1
The game is made up of grid/plane having nine regions, on each region there is a ball moving only on that particular region. A ball moves based on a rhythm of a chosen music, as the balls move, they eventually fade and once they do, the players task will be to answer where the ball might be or what direction is it heading at a given point in time. Each ball is only allowed to go to one of the eight directions namely up, down, left, right, bottom right, bottom left, top right and top left, depending on it location. Moreover, a ball moves a certain number of steps forward and then another number of steps backwards, however going backwards is optional. The game can be found at www.manikhweschool.com and is called Pattern Recognition Version I.
